# Saurabh Saurabh - MBA Portfolio Website

Welcome to my MBA Portfolio Website! This project showcases my educational background, professional experience, skills, and past projects as Saurabh Saurabh, an MBA candidate with a Civil Engineering foundation. Built using Quarto, the site is designed to highlight my journey and achievements, updated as of May 19, 2025, at 08:46 AM EAT.
